<h2>Here are some God Charlie Munger knowledge</h2> <br><br>

1."It takes character to sit with all that cash and to do nothing. I didn't get to the top where I am by going after mediocre opportunities."

 <br><br>

2."To get what you want, you have to deserve what you want. That world is not yet a crazy enough place to reward a whole bunch of people."

   <br><br>

3."Being something and doing something that no one had done before are two different things."

<br><br>

4."Those who keep learning will keep rising in life."

<br><br>

5."If you keep learning all the time you have a huge advantage."

<br><br>

6."You don't have to be brilliant, only a little bit wiser than the other guys, on average, for a long, long time."

<br><br>

7."People calculate too much and think too little."

<br><br>

8."A majority of life's errors are caused by forgetting what one is really trying to do."

 <br><br>

9."The best thing a human can do is to help another human being know more."

<br><br>

10."Knowing what you don't know is more useful than being brilliant."

<br><br>

11."The habit of committing far more time to learning and thinking than to doing is no accident."

<br><br>

12."Like Warren, I had a considerable passion to get rich, not because I wanted Ferrari's -I wanted the independence. I desperately wanted it."

<br><br>

13."One of the greatest ways to avoid trouble is to keep it simple...the system often goes out of control."

<br><br>

14."If you skillfully follow the multidisciplinary path, you will never wish to come back. It would be like cutting off your hands."

<br><br>

15."Just the discipline of having to put your thoughts in order with somebody else is very useful thing."

 <br><br>

16."Opportunity comes to the prepared mind."

<br><br>

17."I met the towering intellectuals in books, not in classroom, which is natural. My family was into all that stuff, getting ahead through discipline, knowledge, and self-control."

<br><br>

18."I paid no attention to the territorial boundaries of academic disciplines and I just grabbed all the big ideas that I could."

 <br><br>

19."It is remarkable how much long-term advantage people like us have gotten by trying to be consistently not stupid, instead of trying to be intelligent."

<br><br>

20."To this day, I have never taken a course anywhere, in chemistry, economics, psychology, or business."

<br><br>

21."I try to get rid of people who confidently answer questions about which they don't have any real knowledge."

<br><br>

22."I believe in the discipline of mastering the best that other people have ever figured out. I don't believe in just sitting down and trying to dream it all up yourself."

<br><br><br><br>

23."Another thing I think should be avoided is extremely intense ideology because it cabbages up one's mind...when you're young it's easy to drift into royalties and when you announce that you're a loyal member...and you're gradually ruining your mind."

<br><br><br><br>

24."Simplicity has a way of improving performance by enabling us to better understand what we are doing."

<br><br>

25."You should avoid sloth and unreliability."

<br><br>

<br><br>

27."People should take away less than they're worth when they are favored by life...I would argue that when you rise high enough in American Business you've got a moral duty to be underpaid"

<br><br>

28."Those of us who have been fortunate have a duty to give back. Whether one gives a lot as one goes along as I do, or a little and then a lot (when one dies) as Warren does, is a matter of personal preference."

<br><br>

29."No man is fit to hold office who isn't perfectly willing to leave it at any time..."

32."We have a passion for keeping things simple."

<br><br>
33."We have three baskets for investing: yes, no, and too tough to understand."



34."Live within your income and save so you can invest. Learn what you need to learn."

 <br><br>


35."It's waiting that helps you as an investor and a lot of people just can't stand to wait. If you didn't get the deferred -gratification gene, you've got to work very hard to overcome that."

 <br><br>


36."A great business at a fair price is superior to a fair business at a great price."

 <br><br>


37."An intelligent investing is value investing, acquiring more than you are paying for."

<br><br>


38."The big money is not in buying or selling, but in the waiting."

<br><br>


39."A lot of people with high IQs are terrible investors because they've got terrible temperaments."

 <br><br>


40."When you borrow a man's car, always return it with a tank of gas."

 <br><br>

41."... the most famous composer in the world but was utterly miserable most of the time, and of the reasons was because he always overspent his income. This was Mozart. If Mozart couldn't get by with this kind of asinine conduct, I don't think you should try."

 <br><br>

42."We're not interested in taking a substantial chance of taking a lot of very decent people back to 'Go' so we can have one more zero on our net worth."

 <br><br>

43."The liabilities are always 100 percent good. It's the assets you have to worry about."

<br><br>

46."Wall Street has too much wealth and political power."

 <br><br>

47."It's like the slaughter of the innocents. It makes the people who run Las Vegas seem like good people."

 <br><br>

48."I've seen so much folly and stupidity on the part of our major philanthropic groups, including the world bank. I really have more confidence in building up the more capitalistic ventures like Costco."

 <br><br>

49."We both (Warren Buffett) insist on a lot of time being available almost every day to just sit and think. That is very uncommon in American business. We read and think."

 <br><br>

50."Our game is to recognize a big idea when it comes along when one doesn't come along very often."

   <br><br>

51."Ninety-nine percent of the troubles that threaten our civilization come from too optimistic, therefore we should have a system where the accounting is a way more conservative."

<br><br>

52."A lot of people think if you just had more process and more compliance- checks and double-checks and so forth-you could create a better world. We just try to operate in a seamless web of deserved trust and be careful of whom we trust."

 <br><br>

53."Everywhere there is a large commission, there is a high probability of a rip-off."
<br><br>
54."Part of what you must learn is how to handle mistakes and new facts that change the odds. Life, in part, is like a poker game wherein you have to learn to quit sometimes when holding a much-loved hand."
<br><br>  
55."In my whole life, I have known no wise people...who didn't read all the time --none, zero. You'd be amazed at how much Warren reads --at how much I read...They think I'm a book with a couple of legs sticking out."
<br><br>  
56."Develop into a lifelong self-learner through voracious reading; cultivate curiosity and strive to become a little wiser every day."
<br><br>  
57."Assume life will be really tough, and then ask if you can handle it. If the answer is yes, you've won."
<br><br>
58."Just because you like it does not mean that the world will necessarily give it to you."
<br><br>
59."I would argue that passion is more important than brainpower."
<br><br>
60."Is there such a thing as a cheerful pessimist? That's what I am."
<br><br>  
61."The iron rule of nature is: You get what you reward for. If you want ants to come, you put sugar on the floor."
<br><br>
62."Another thing, of course, is that life will have terrible blows in it, horrible blows, unfair blows. It doesn't matter. And some people recover and others don't..."
<br><br>
63."Confucious said that real knowledge is knowing the extent of one's ignorance. Aristotle and Socrates said the same thing. Is it a skill that can be taught or learned? It probably can, if you have enough of a stake riding on the outcome..."
<br><br>
64."Wisdom acquisition is a moral duty. It's not something you do just to advance in life...You are not going to get very far in life based on what you already know. You're going to advance in life by what you learn after you leave here."
<br><br>
65."Some people are extraordinarily good at knowing the limits of their knowledge because they have to be."
<br><br>
66."Spend each day trying to be a little wiser than you were when you woke up. Discharge your duties faithfully and well. Systematically you get ahead, but not necessarily in fast spurts...At the end of the day if you live long enough most people get what they deserve."
<br><br>  
67."One solution fits all is not the way to go. All these cultures are different. The right culture for the Mayo Clinic is different from the right culture at a Hollywood movie studio. You can't run all these places with a cookie-cutter solution."
<br><br>  
68."There's a tendency to think that our present politicians are much worse than we had in the past. But we tend to forget how awful our politicians were in the past."
<br><br>  
69."The highest form that civilization can reach is a seamless web of deserved trust-not much procedure, just totally reliable people correctly trusting one another..."

<br><br>
71."Remember that reputation and integrity are your most valuable assets and can be lost in a heartbeat."
<br><br>
72."Most people are too fretful, they worry too much. Success means being very patient, but aggressive when it's time."
<br><br>  
73."Always take the high road, it's far less crowded."
<br><br>
74."You don't have to have the ability that quantum mechanics requires. You just have to know a few simple things and really know them."
<br><br>
75."Don't drift into self-pity because it doesn't solve any problems."
<br><br>  
76."It's not supposed to be easy. Anyone who finds it easy is stupid."
<br><br>
77."You need patience, discipline, and agility to take losses and adversity without going crazy."

        <h2>16 brilliant quotes from Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's right-hand man </h2><br><br>
        Overestimating your intelligence could be a major pitfall.
        
        "If you think your IQ is 160 but it’s 150, you’re a disaster. It’s much better to have a 130 IQ and think it’s 120."
        Source: Berkshire Hathaway 2009 meeting via The Daily Beast<br><br>
        Smart people do dumb things.
        "We recognized early on that very smart people do very dumb things, and we wanted to know why and who, so we could avoid them."
        Source: Berkshire Hathaway 2007 meeting via Buffett FAQ<br><br>
        Invest in the business that any fool can run.
        
        "Invest in a business any fool can run, because someday a fool will. If it won't stand a little mismanagement, it's not much of a business. We're not looking for mismanagement, even if we can withstand it."
        Source: Berkshire Hathaway 2009 meeting via Buffett FAQ<br><br>
        There's only one way to the top: hard work.
        
        "Obviously if you want to get good at something which is competitive, you have to think about it and practice a lot. You have to keep learning because [the] world keeps changing and competitors keep learning. You have to go to bed wiser than you got up. As you try to master what you are trying to do — people who do that almost never fail utterly. Very few have ever failed with that approach. You may rise slowly, but you are sure to rise."
        Source: Berkshire Hathaway 2010 meeting via Buffett FAQ<br><br>Do what you like and are good at.
        "You'll do better if you have passion for something in which you have aptitude. If Warren had gone into ballet, no one would have heard of him."
        Source: Berkshire Hathaway 2008 meeting via Buffett FAQ<br><br>
        If you're lazy and unreliable, it doesn't even matter what you're good at.
        
        "What do you want to avoid? Such an easy answer: sloth and unreliability. If you're unreliable it doesn't matter what your virtues are. You're going to crater immediately. Doing what you have faithfully engaged to do should be an automatic part of your conduct. You want to avoid sloth and unreliability."
        Source: Charlie Munger's USC Law Commencement Speech, May 2007<br><br>
        Life will knock you down, but you can get back up and learn from it.
        
        "Life will have terrible blows in it, horrible blows, unfair blows. It doesn't matter. And some people recover and others don't. And there I think the attitude of Epictetus is the best. He thought that every missed chance in life was an opportunity to behave well, every missed chance in life was an opportunity to learn something, and that your duty was not to be submerged in self-pity, but to utilize the terrible blow in constructive fashion. That is a very good idea."
        Source: Charlie Munger's USC Law Commencement Speech, May 2007<br><br>
        Keep it simple.
        "Well, opportunity cost is a huge filter in life. If you've got two suitors who are eager to have you, but one is way better than the other, you're going to choose that one rather than the other. That's the way we filter stock buying opportunities. Our ideas are so simple. People keep asking us for mysteries, but all we have are the most elementary ideas."
        Source: Berkshire Hathaway 1997 meeting via Buffett FAQ<br><br>
        Self-pity doesn't solve anything.
        
        "Generally speaking, envy, resentment, revenge and self-pity are disastrous modes of thought. Self-pity gets fairly close to paranoia, and paranoia is one of the very hardest things to reverse. You do not want to drift into self-pity. ... Self-pity will not improve the situation."
        Source: Charlie Munger's USC Law Commencement Speech, May 2007<br><br>
        Being smart and doing something that no one has done before are two different things.
        "It reminds me of the young guy who went up to Mozart and said, 'I'd like to write symphonies.' When Mozart said, 'You're too young,' the young man replied, 'But you were young when you started.' Mozart pointed out, 'Yes, but I wasn't asking anyone else for advice on how to do it.'"
        Source: Berkshire Hathaway 2006 meeting via Buffett FAQ<br><br>
        The greatest minds are in books, not classrooms.
        
        "I met the towering intellectuals in books, not in the classroom, which is natural. I can't remember when I first read Ben Franklin. I had Thomas Jefferson over my bed at seven or eight. My family was into all that stuff, getting ahead through discipline, knowledge, and self-control."
        Source: "Damn Right!: Behind the Scenes with Berkshire Hathaway Billionaire Charlie Munger"<br><br>
        It's "crazy" for an expert to diversify.
        
        "Students learn corporate finance at business schools. They are taught that the whole secret is diversification. But the exact rule is the opposite. The 'know-nothing' investor should practice diversification, but it is crazy if you are an expert. The goal of investment is to find situations where it is safe not to diversify. If you only put 20% into the opportunity of a life-time, you are not being rational. Very seldom do we get to buy as much of any good idea as we would like to."
        Source: Berkshire Hathaway 2008 meeting via Buffett FAQ<br><br>
        I got 99 problems, and optimistic accounting is all of them.
        Ninety-nine percent "of the troubles that threaten our civilization come from too optimistic accounting. And yet these damn accountants with their desire for mathematical purity want to devote exactly as much attention to accounting that is too pessimistic as they do to accounting that is too optimistic — which is crazy. [Ninety-nine percent] of the problems come from being too optimistic. Therefore, we should have a system where the accounting is way more conservative."
        Source: University of Michigan discussion<br><br>
        Keep a close eye on the assets.
        
        "The liabilities are always 100% good. It's the assets you have to worry about."
        Source: 2008 Wesco Financial annual meeting, quoted in Stanford Business School paper<br><br>
        If Mozart couldn't get away with it, then neither can you.
        
        "Another thing that does one in, of course, is the self-serving bias to which we're all subject. You think the 'True Little Me' is entitled to do what it wants to do. And, for instance, why shouldn't the True Little Me overspend my income. There once was a man who became the most famous composer in the world but was utterly miserable most of the time, and one of the reasons was because he always overspent his income. That was Mozart. If Mozart can't get by with this kind of asinine conduct, I don't think you should try."
        Source: Charlie Munger's USC Law Commencement Speech, May 2007<br><br>
        In the future, someone will come along and do even better.
        
        "Ben Graham was a truly formidable mind, and he also had a clarity in writing, and we talk over and over again about the power of a few simple ideas thoroughly assimilated, and that happened with Graham's ideas which came to me indirectly through Warren, but some also directly from Graham. The interesting thing for me is that Buffett the former protégé — by the way Buffett was the best student Graham had in 30 years of teaching at Columbia — became better than Graham. That's the natural outcome — as Milton said, 'If I've seen a little farther than other men, it's by standing on the shoulders of giants.' So, Warren stood on Ben's shoulders, but he ended up seeing more than Ben. No doubt somebody will come along and do a lot better than we have."
